# drive_gazebo_sim

Gazebo simulation of the vehicle used by the drive team.

Currently includes camera/distance sensors (including Lidar) and steering/torque motors with PID controllers and corresponding ROS interfaces.

Values are approximately physically correct, as they are based on datasheets where applicable, and on CAD models otherwise.
